My Github account is Mikecope81.github.io
The Repository that I created is also Mikecope81@github.io
I opened the Github Desktop and selected file, clone respository, clicked on my Repository Mikecope81@github.io and clicked on Clone repository. Noticed a new file downloaded to my file folder that is identical.
